Library Management System
This is a desktop application developed using C# and .NET, with MySQL as the database backend. The Library Management System allows users to manage library records such as books, authors, and members. It provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with and manage library data efficiently.

Features
User Authentication: Secure login and registration system for administrators and users using MySQL for user management.
Book Management: Add, update, and remove books from the library collection.
Member Management: Add and update library members, assign books to them, and track their borrowings.
Search Functionality: Search for books by title, author, or genre.
Transaction Tracking: Keep track of issued books and their due dates.
Data Validation: Ensure data integrity by validating inputs before interacting with the database.
Error Handling: Includes error handling mechanisms to provide informative messages for common issues like database connection problems or invalid input.
Tech Stack
Frontend:
C# (Windows Forms) for building the desktop application.
Backend:
.NET Framework for building the application logic.
MySQL for database management.
ADO.NET for database connectivity.
Database
The application uses MySQL as its database system to store and manage data. The database contains tables for storing books, members, transactions, and other necessary information related to the library. Make sure the database is properly set up, and the connection string in your project is configured accordingly.

Installation
1. Clone or Download the Repository
Clone the repository or download the application files to your local system.

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
2. Install Required Software
MySQL Server: Ensure MySQL is installed and running on your system.
Visual Studio: You need Visual Studio (with the .NET desktop development workload) to build and run the C# application.
MySQL Connector for .NET: Install the MySQL Connector for .NET to enable connectivity between your application and MySQL database.
3. Set up the Database
Create a new database in MySQL.
Set up tables for books, members, transactions, etc., based on the application's requirements.
Update the connection string in your C# application to match your MySQL server configuration.
4. Build and Run the Application
Open the project in Visual Studio.
Build the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
Run the application by clicking on the Start button (F5) in Visual Studio.
Usage
Login: Users can log in to the system with their credentials stored in the MySQL database.
Book Management: Add, view, and manage books in the library.
Member Management: Add and manage library members, and issue books to them.
Transaction Management: Track issued books and their return status.

In your Library Management System project, the Login Form handles user authentication by storing user credentials, and the Library Form manages book records by storing data such as book titles, authors, and genres.

Here’s an updated description for your project to include these features:

Library Management System
This desktop application is developed in C# and .NET, with MySQL as the database backend. The Library Management System provides functionality to manage users and books through two primary forms: the Login Form for user authentication and the Library Form for managing book data.

Features
1. Login Form
User Authentication: Allows users to log in with their credentials (email and password). The login form ensures only registered users can access the system.
User Data Storage: Stores user details (username, email, password) in a MySQL database, enabling secure login functionality.
2. Library Form
Book Management: Enables adding new books, viewing book details, and updating existing records (title, author, genre, etc.).
Book Data Storage: Stores book information in a MySQL database, allowing administrators to manage the library's book collection effectively.
3. Search Functionality
Book Search: Users can search for books by title, author, or genre to find specific books in the library's database.
4. Transaction Tracking: Keeps track of issued books and their return status.
Tech Stack
Frontend:
C# (Windows Forms) for building the user interface.
Backend:
.NET Framework for the application logic.
MySQL for database management.
ADO.NET for database connectivity.
Database
The application uses MySQL for storing data. There are tables for users (to store user credentials) and books (to store details of the books). The database is connected via ADO.NET to perform operations such as adding, updating, and retrieving user and book data.

1. Clone or Download the Repository
Clone the repository or download the application files to your local system.

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
2. Install Required Software

MySQL Connector for .NET: Install the MySQL Connector for .NET to enable connectivity between your application and MySQL database.
3. Set up the Database
Create a new database in MySQL.
Set up tables for users (for login credentials) and books (for library records).
Update the connection string in your C# application to match your MySQL server configuration.
4. Build and Run the Application
Open the project in Visual Studio.
Build the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
Run the application by clicking on the Start button (F5) in Visual Studio.
Usage
Login Form: Users can log in by entering their credentials (email and password). If credentials are valid, they are granted access to the system.
Library Form: Administrators can add, update, and view book records in the system. Books are stored in the MySQL database for efficient management.
Search Books: Search for books based on various criteria (title, author, genre).
